\title{Reports the output of testing all assumptions for a multilevel model}
\usage{
mlm_assumptions(model, re_type = c("NA"))
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A linear mixed-effects model of class lmerMod, lmerModLmerTest, or glmerMod of type binomial.}

\item{re_type}{A value indicating whether a model with two random effects is nested or cross-classified}
}
\value{
If \code{re_type} is "NA", the proportion of variance at the random effect is computed.

If re_type = "nested", the likeness of y scores in the same level 3 unit (the proportion of variance at Level3_factor), the likeness of y scores in the same level 2 units in the same level 3 unit (proportion of variance at Level3_factor and Level2_factor), and the likeness of level 2 units in the same level 3 unit (proportion of Level2_factor variance at Level3_factor) are computed.

If re_type = "cc", the likeness of y scores in the same C1_factor unit (correlation between outcome values of units in same C1_factor but different C2_factor), the likeness of y scores in the same C2_factor (correlation between outcome values of units in the same C2_factor but different C2_factor), and the likeness of y scores in the same C1_factor and C2_factor combination (correlation between outcome values of units in the same C2_factor and C2_factor) are computed.

Tests the relevant assumptions of the specified multilevel model.

\examples{
# Gaussian
## Read in data
data(instruction)
## Create model
mod <- lme4::lmer(mathgain ~ mathkind + (1 | classid), data = instruction)
## Evaluate assumptions
mlm_assumptions(mod)

# Logistic
## Read in data
data(reporting)
## Create model
mod <- lme4::glmer(mention.outliers ~ Basics + (1 | Journal), data = reporting, family = "binomial")
## Evaluate assumptions
mlm_assumptions(mod)
